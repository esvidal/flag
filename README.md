create a platform/game to express my golf system

## Everyone Starts at Zero
Well I am at zero. I would like to understand what this means.

### Golf to Me
Golf to me is the practice of execution.  
When you watch  human or an animal completly immersed in a task like throwing, jumping, running, there is a stillness in their intention.  
Like the head stillness of a cheetah locking into their prey.  
**Locking in** is the key that I see.  
How does one get better at that?  
Is that the problem though? 
Wouldn't it be making sure you are not getting distracted?
