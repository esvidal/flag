create a platform/game to express my golf system

### Golf to Me
Golf to me is the practice of execution.  
When you watch a human or an animal completely immersed in the action like throwing, jumping, running, there is a stillness in their intention.  
Like the head stillness of a cheetah locking onto their prey.

### Frustration
What really makes this game so difficult is when your stuck in your head, obsessing over your mechanics during a round.  
Its the most exhausting, rage inducing feelings that really ruins your round.  

### Release your brakes
You've been so battered that the only thing you have left is just release your brakes.  

### 7 seconds
They've recorded all the final rounds of players leading the tournment.  
Recorded all the shots.  
They noticed there golf sequence starting as they are looking behind the ball to when the finish the shot.  
They found that all the player time as an average of 7 seconds.  
The sequence:
- Behind the ball looking at the target
- Walking towards the ball
- Place the club behind the ball
- Take your stance
- Look at the target
- Look at the ball
- Swing
- Hold finish
