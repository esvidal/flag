        <h2>What I am doing now...</h2>
        <p>Currently, just putting together the file. I have yet to brainstorm what to actually build out.</p>
        <!--Note: Not sure exactly what this will become, but there is a goal/destination and I don't want to type it out here.-->
        <h3>Thoughts...</h3>
        <p>I would like to really think about what are issues that I can running into that I would like to solve.</p>
        <p>Here is a simple list that comes to mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comparing myself to others</li>
            <li>Thinking about the score during a round</li>
            <li>Fasting during a round versus playing in a comfortably fed state</li>
            <li>Bottlenecking myself instead of just letting it go</li><!--Need to think about this more.-->
        </ul>
